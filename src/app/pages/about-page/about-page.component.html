      <p>Shantanurao Laxmanrao Kirloskar is our inspiration for his dynamism, perseverance and strong principles. A man of practical thinking, SLK was one of the earliest successful entrepreneurs of modern India.</p>

      <p> SLK became the first Indian to graduate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926. For his immense contribution to trade and industry, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1965; one of the highest Indian civilian awards.</p>

      <p> A commemorative postage stamp was released by the Indian Prime Minister marking SLKâ€™s centenary in 2003.</p>
